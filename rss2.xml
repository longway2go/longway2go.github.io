      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everybody need money, because money is essential to support our daily life. After my quit from last company, I have a financial problem. It’s my salary just meet my expenses. Without more money, my life can’t overcome any unexpect things. Since then, the question is arrounding my head now and then - ‘How to earn more money?’.</p><p>I think most of you want more money, just like me. The rich are just a small group. Well, here’s the way I’m trying:</p><h2 id="1-Be-compentent-to-my-basic-job"><a href="#1-Be-compentent-to-my-basic-job" class="headerlink" title="1. Be compentent to my basic job"></a>1. Be compentent to my basic job</h2><p>My job is the fundamental financial source that assure me to support my family. So it’s the most important thing I keep in mind. No matter what job the boss asks me to do, I’ll do. and I will do it better than ordinary.</p><p>I don’t think I’m clever than others, but I’m sure I know a lot of higher efficient tools that helps me finish my work faster. So that I can save time to make difference. </p><h2 id="2-No-more-games"><a href="#2-No-more-games" class="headerlink" title="2. No more games"></a>2. No more games</h2><p>Playing games is the most import thing during my off hours, and I play with my wife and friends. It continues for almost two years. We even build a WeChat Group (<code>social APP, seems to twitter</code>) to invite others to join the game. Surely we enjoy it, and have a lot of fun. But We waste our time.</p><p>Finally, I’m determined to quit. No more Games, just focus on thinking and Studying. Up to now, I haven’t play games for 2 weeks, it feels good. Night seems longer than before.</p><h2 id="3-Write-Blog"><a href="#3-Write-Blog" class="headerlink" title="3. Write Blog"></a>3. Write Blog</h2><p>I recently read Mr. Wang’s Blog:<a href="http://home.wangjianshuo.com/20141024_ruanyifengs-message.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blog is Dead – Let’s Move On</a>. I was touched by his words: </p><blockquote><p>Now it is the time to re-think about the right tool to make some noise. I understand the desperate feeling of a Kong-Fu master see a gun. But the miracle always comes from the person who quickly learn to use the gun, instead of compete with gun by practicing Kong Fu hard.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with him. As a young man, I use WeChat to communicate with my friend. If China allows twitter or facebook, certainly I will choose them. I nearly read blog.</p><p>But I choose to write English Blog. I think it’ll help me improve my English, because I have no chance to use English on my daily life. And I hope to build contact with outside. Maybe this can make it possible. We’ll see.</p><h2 id="4-Do-amateur-projects"><a href="#4-Do-amateur-projects" class="headerlink" title="4. Do amateur projects"></a>4. Do amateur projects</h2><p>I’m plannig to do some projects on my spare time. First and most important, I’ll enhance my software programming skills. Second, this enriches my resume. Third, this may bring me money.</p><p>At last, I’m planning to develop a daily account software. I will give user more choices, such as windows desktop software, Android APP, web application, WeChat Mini Program. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Because GitLab need higher computer performance, the Pi is not capable.</p><p>Then I turn to Gogs. Gogs is similar to GitHub, but it’s functions is not as many as GitHub’s. Gogs is just satisfy me.</p><p>Here’s the installation steps:</p><h2 id="Auto-publish-your-own-Book"><a href="#Auto-publish-your-own-Book" class="headerlink" title="Auto publish your own Book"></a>Auto publish your own Book</h2><p>I have a Kindle PaperWhite2.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Everyone! Today is worth remembering for me, since I finally start to build my own blog site. </p><h2 id="Who-am-I"><a href="#Who-am-I" class="headerlink" title="Who am I?"></a>Who am I?</h2><p>I’m a software engineer who loves coding and has much more interesting to new technology. Three years ago, I determined to be a full stack engineer, which seems impossible to me. Now I’m on my way. </p><p>I’m skilled with C, C++, MFC, Java, JavaScript, Docker, Jenkins, Node.js, and so on. Maybe it’s time now. I will try to combine these skills, make useful products.</p><h2 id="Thanks"><a href="#Thanks" class="headerlink" title="Thanks"></a>Thanks</h2><p>There’s an old saying, ‘A journey of a thousand miles begins with single step’. But I want to thank some person. Without them, without this blog.</p><p>First of all, I want to say thanks to my wife. Because she dose the most housework and cooks dinner for me, so that I can focus on my interest. And she encourages me when I feel down. It’s my lucky to marry her.</p><p>Second, I want to say thanks to my only pen-pal friend. We meet in about 7 years ago. She helps me to improve my English writing and gives me confidence. Because English is not my native language, I rarely pratice English on my daily life.</p><p>At last, I want to thank myself. Life is hard to ordinary people, including me. I have made too many choice at the cross roads. I thanks to myself to never give up, and rebuild my strength after every fails.</p>]]></content:encoded>
