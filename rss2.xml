Because GitLab need higher computer performance, the Pi is not capable.</p><p>Then I turn to Gogs. Gogs is similar to GitHub, but it’s functions is not as many as GitHub’s. Gogs is just satisfy me.</p><p>Here’s the installation steps:</p><h2 id="Auto-publish-your-own-Book"><a href="#Auto-publish-your-own-Book" class="headerlink" title="Auto publish your own Book"></a>Auto publish your own Book</h2><p>I have a Kindle PaperWhite2.

If you don’t know Markdown yet, then I suggest you to get start to learn Markdown. You’ll not regret this.</p><p>My book will be saved with the suffix of ‘md’. Then We move to next step.</p><h3 id="Generate-book"><a href="#Generate-book" class="headerlink" title="Generate book"></a>Generate book</h3><p>When I say I want generate book, it means I want to convert Markdown file to MOBI file. </p><p>What is MOBI file?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Everyone! Today is worth remembering for me, since I finally start to build my own blog site. </p><h2 id="Who-am-I"><a href="#Who-am-I" class="headerlink" title="Who am I?"></a>Who am I?</h2><p>I’m a software engineer who loves coding and has much more interesting to new technology. Three years ago, I determined to be a full stack engineer, which seems impossible to me. Now I’m on my way. </p><p>I’m skilled with C, C++, MFC, Java, JavaScript, Docker, Jenkins, Node.js, and so on. Maybe it’s time now. I will try to combine these skills, make useful products.</p><h2 id="Thanks"><a href="#Thanks" class="headerlink" title="Thanks"></a>Thanks</h2><p>There’s an old saying, ‘A journey of a thousand miles begins with single step’. But I want to thank some person. Without them, without this blog.</p><p>First of all, I want to say thanks to my wife. Because she dose the most housework and cooks dinner for me, so that I can focus on my interest. And she encourages me when I feel down. It’s my lucky to marry her.</p><p>Second, I want to say thanks to my only pen-pal friend. We meet in about 7 years ago. She helps me to improve my English writing and gives me confidence. Because English is not my native language, I rarely pratice English on my daily life.</p><p>At last, I want to thank myself. Life is hard to ordinary people, including me. I have made too many choice at the cross roads. I thanks to myself to never give up, and rebuild my strength after every fails.</p>]]></content:encoded>
